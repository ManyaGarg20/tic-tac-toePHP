        <p>
            You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people
            think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple
            as
            you think!
            Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the
            person
            playing against you might do next.

        <h3 class="h3-inst">RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h3>
        <p>
            1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
            <br>
            2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in
            empty squares.
            <br>
            3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
            <br>
            4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

        <h3 class="h3-inst">HOW CAN YOU WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</h3>
        <p>
         <li> To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means
            figuring out what you need to do to win.</li>  

         <li>  Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to
            figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.</li> 

        <li> After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at
            the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.</li>  

         <li> You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer
            gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will
            win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</li>  

          <li>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at
            least you'll tie.</li>
